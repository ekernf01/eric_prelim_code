This series of tests is designed to see whether using a fairly large bandwidth during resampling can help alleviate the sample impoverishment problem in Wilkinsonâ€™s scheme. Rounds one through three use 1_000, 10_000, and 100_000 samples with a bandwidth of 0.5 (normal kernel). Results were still bad, essentially showing descendents of only 1 or 2 particles, but with wider clouds around them. 

Round 4 helped debug a new feature: saving samples at every stage.
Round 5 helped debug another new feature: contour plots.
Round 6 helped debug another new feature: switch to @save and @load.

Finally, with some assurance that data would be saved and plotted properly, Round 7 used 1_000_000 particles with a bandwidth of 0.5 (normal kernel).
