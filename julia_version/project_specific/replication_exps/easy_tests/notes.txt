Notes for tests in easy_test folder

These tests follow up on three bugs that I found in my Gillespie implementation. After looking back in the files from my old tests, those bugs do not appear to have affected my results. Thus, I am pursuing the plan I agreed upon with Marina: to search for an easy problem that will “prove” my sampler is working.

Round 1 experiments with short intervals and low measurement error. It had bad results.
Round 2 experiments with short intervals and low measurement error, but a longer time series. It had bad results, too. 

I had done many unsuccessful tests of this sort before starting this set of notes. They either 1) had a posterior that stayed in a big brick or 2) fragmented into a cloud with no spatial coherence. So, I switched back to the simple 1-molecule system.

Round 3 used a short run in that system, but the simulated data gave no hints: the molecule count was constant over the whole simulation. 

Round 4 tried a longer simulation. I used only 10,000 particles; doesn’t seem like quite enough. 

Round 5/6: abandoned this idea and went back to on that had showed promise before: a 300-second run split up into 10 (round 5) or 20 (round 6) intervals. Of note: these rounds used a noise sd of 5 and 100,000 particles, but that was not enough t stave off problems.

Round 7 tried that but with 1_000_000 particles. Round 8 used 10_000_000 particles. Round 9 lenghtened the intervals back to 30 seconds, doubling the simulation time. Results showed definite spatial patterns, but were otherwise discouraging.

At round 10, I de-coupled the assumed noise sd from the true noise sd and did a 300-second run (10 30-sec intervals) with 1e6 particles.


I do not rememeber how many goddam times Julia crashed while I worked on these. Worse than 2/5 by reckoning.
