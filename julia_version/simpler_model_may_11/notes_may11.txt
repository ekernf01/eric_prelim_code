Notes

The first day of experiments, May 8th, showed poor results, indicating the sampler probably contains an error. To simplify the situation, this second day of experiments has no dynamical systems component: no chemical reactions occur, and we just try to infer the initial state given multiple measurements. One-dimensional underlying state, flat prior, binomial error. The posterior is way off in round one, which used 1000 particles. 

Round 2 used 100,000 particles. It took 50 seconds. The posterior is still narrow and in the wrong place.
