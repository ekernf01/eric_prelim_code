The posteriors for the quick tests were terrible: tight and in the wrong places. The simulated runs had high variance, with not much info about the params in the simulation. So, 50_intervals_30_secs was meant to see what happens when more info is available, but that was terrible too. So, I tried it with only 24 intervals, but 300 seconds per: these are the settings in the paper. 

Round one took only 50 seconds, one third the time. The posterior was still terrible.

Round two used 1,000,000 particles instead of 100,000. It took 1175 seconds (~20 minutes).  The posterior was still completely wrong, and the magnitude-switching described in the folder quick tests friday may 8 persists.
